# machine-learning-algorithms

## Part A : 
Implementations of 3 different machine learning algorithms for text classification of movie reviews from the "IMDB dataset" into two (distinct) categories (e.g., positive/negative sentiment).

## Part B : 
Performance comparison of said implementations with the Scikit-learn implementations of the same machine learning algorithms

## Part C :
 Comparison of the results of Parts A and B with the results of an MLP with a sliding window and/or an RNN, implemented in Tensorflow/Keras, representing words with word embeddings.
